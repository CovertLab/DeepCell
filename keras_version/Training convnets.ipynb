We typically train 5 models at a time so we can average the predictions - we've found that using model parallelism in this fashion leads to more rebust segmentation. Because our training data has 2 channels (phase image and nuclear marker) and we are looking for 3 features (edge, interior, and background), we need to specify those flags.
