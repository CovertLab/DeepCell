__DeepCell__ is a program for segmenting individual cells in microscopy images using deep learning. Image segmentation is frequently the analysis bottleneck in single-cell live-cell imaging experiments. This program describes our efforts to approach this problem using deep learning.

Details about __DeepCell__ can be found in our manuscript:
David Van Valen, Takamasa Kudo, Keara Lane, Derek Macklin, Nicolas Quach, Mialy DeFelice, Inbal Maayan, Yu Tanouchi, Euan Ashley, and Markus Covert, [Deep learning automates the quantitative analysis of individual cells in live-cell imaging experiments](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005177). PLoS Comput Biol 12(11): e1005177. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005177
